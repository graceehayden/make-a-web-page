  <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title"> HTML</div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>HTML is the text we read online, or, more fancily,
        hypertext markup language.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="concept-title"> Tags and Elements</div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>This is an example of a paragraph tag. Tags are used
        to distinguish elements, or parts contained within the tags. 
        The 'em' tag, for instance, places emphasis on text by 
        <em>italicizing</em> it. The 'p' tag I've used separates the text 
        within it into... PARAGRAPHS.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="concept-title">Why Computers Are Stupid</div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>Computers need to be told what to do. They will misread
        all unedited typos and ruin code, lest you <b>change
        your ways</b>, Ebenezer. I promise to slow down and appreciate 
        the meaning in <del>Christmas</del> coding.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="concept-title">Inline and Block Elements</div>
      <div class="concept-description">     
        <p>Block elements put themselves in blocks. Inline's don't. 
        Block elements are like Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada 
        and inline elements are all Anne Hathaway and totally clueless
        about style in comparison to Meryl, but they act
        act as if it doesn't matter, and while I bet they totally want
        to be apathetically cool too, they're just basic. omg.</p>

  <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">Developer Tools</div>
      <div class="concept-description">       
        <p>Everything designed on a website is in blocks. If I were a front-end
        developer, I'd be seeing blocks, blocks, blocks. Within the blocks are
        trees of elements that may be designed separately based on their
        tags. CSS is commonly used for that design.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="concept-title">HTML is Structured Like a Family Tree</div>
      <div class="concept-description"> 
        <p>As seen in this code, HTML elements are tiered within one another,
        which allows for visual ease in picking out parts of a text for styling.</p>
        <p>Each new element within another is indented and the indentations get deeper
        the more elements that get nested within others. 
      </div> 
          <div class="concept-title">Text Editors</div>
      <div class="concept-description">  
      </div>
        <p>HTML is written with text editors. I am currently writing in
        Text Wrangler, which is less irritating to me than Sublime
        because it doesn't automatically close tags, but it definitely does not make
        indentation any easier. I don't know why that's so bothersome. I must be new!</p>

  <h2>Lesson 3: Adding Style to HTML Using CSS</h2>
  <div class="concept-title">Avoiding Repetition</div>
      <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-description"> 
        <p>If programmers repeat the same code over and over in different places, any
        future changes will be harder to make, as they will have to go back and find each
        place it was used.</p>
        <p>"div" and "class" labels allow for a universal application in multiple places
        with a particular label in a document. The styling for every element with that
        label can be done in one place. </p>
      </div>
    <div class="concept-title">CSS</div>
      <div class="concept-description">  
        <p>CSS, or cascading style sheets, is styling done in a separate document that
        is linked to on the index page. It allows for non-redundancies by the assignment
        of classes, etcetera.
